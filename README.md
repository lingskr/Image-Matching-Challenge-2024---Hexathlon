The goal of this competition is to construct precise 3D maps using sets of images in diverse scenarios and environments. You’ll develop a model to generate accurate spatial representations, regardless of the source domain—images taken from drones, amidst dense forests, during nighttime, or any of the six problem categories.

Last year’s Image Matching Challenge reconstructed 3D scenes from several different angles. This year we’ve increased the variance to include many problems in a single competition. Solutions may be versatile or go deep on one or more categories.
